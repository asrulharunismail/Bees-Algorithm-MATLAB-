include Basic, Standard, and two parameters version
You can choose one of 6 available versions:
  * Basic_BA.m (Basic version of Bees Algorithm for continuous problem)
  * Basic_BA_2.m (Basic version of Bees Algorithm  with 2 parameters for continuous problem)
  * Standard_BA.m (Standard version of Bees Algorithm for continuous problem)
  * Standard_BA_2.m (Standard version of Bees Algorithm  with 2 parameters for continuous problem)
  * Basic_Combi_BA.m (Basic version of Bees Algorithm for combinatorial problem)
  * Basic_Combi_BA.m (Basic version of Bees Algorithm  with 2 parameters for combinatorial problem)
The continuous problem --> benchmark test functions,
The combinatorial problem --> TSP (TSPLIB)
